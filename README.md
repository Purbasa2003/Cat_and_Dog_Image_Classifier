## Cat_vs_Dog_Image_Classifier

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning model that can classify images as either cats or dogs. The model was developed using Python and various data science libraries.

# Project Overview:
The goal of this project was to build an image classification model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs. This was accomplished by following a standard machine learning workflow, including:

# Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Images of cats and dogs was collected and downloaded from kaggle, which was used to train the model. On top of this, several other pictures were taken from google as to test the model. The images were then preprocessed, including resizing, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.

# Model Development:
Several different machine learning models were explored and evaluated, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and random forest classifiers. The final model chosen was a CNN, which demonstrated the highest accuracy on the test set.

# Model Evaluation: 
The performance of the final model was evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 95% on the test set.

# Deployment:
The model was exported and can be used to classify new images of cats and dogs uploaded by users.
